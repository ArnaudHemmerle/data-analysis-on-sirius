Specifically, after the thin films are annealed at or above a critical temperature, the thin film thickness is largely retained when exposed to the original solvent, while for lower annealing temperatures material loss occurs, i.e., the thin film thickness is reduced due to rapid dissolution. The results of various techniques including grazing-incidence wide-angle x-ray scattering (GIWAXS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and ultraviolet-visible-near infrared (UV--vis-NIR) absorption spectroscopy suggest physical changes as the cause for the increased solvent resistance. Such annealed films also show stable electrical characteristics in bottom-gate, top-contact (BGTC) organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) even after solvent exposure. In initial tests, a multitude of technologically relevant polymers show such behavior, underlining the potential impact of such temperature treatments for the fabrication of multi-layer polymer devices.},

  abstract = {A series of phenalenone-lipid conjugates (1A, 1B, 1C, 2) have been synthesized to compensate for the poor water solubility of the photosensitizer phenalenone (PN) and promote the formation of nano-assemblies. We show that the organization and structure of monolayers upon compression strongly depend on the nature of the linker connecting PN to the lipid backbone, and the number of C18 chains. Monolayer properties at the air-water interface were analyzed by surface pressure measurements, Brewster angle and atomic force microscopies, grazing incidence X-ray diffraction, and X-ray reflectivity. Whereas conjugate 1C (ester bond) organizes into multilayers upon compression, conjugates 1A, 1B, and 2 form stable monolayers whose structure is controlled by van der Waals (vdW) interactions between C18 chains, intermolecular H-bonding involving the linker, and for 1B, {$\pi$}-{$\pi$} stacking of PN moieties. Conjugate 1A (amide-triazole linker) is structured into a rectangular network of chains with an order that extends only to the molecule of the adjacent cell. Conjugate 1B (amide bond) forms two incommensurate networks, one for the chains and the other for the headgroups. The distance between molecules in the next near neighbor chain lattice and the sufficient degree of freedom of PN groups allow the latter to pile up via {$\pi$}-{$\pi$} interactions below the chains in a rectangular cell. Conjugate 2 with its double chain adopts a similar behavior to that of a saturated phospholipid. Strong vdW interactions predominate and allow, at high surface pressure, hexagonal packing with no chain tilt. The distance between molecules prevents PN stacking. The identified PN derivative structures explain the linker's impact on the formation and stability of nano-assemblies.},

In order to meet the increasing demand of advanced real-time characterization of nanoscale materials, the beamline optics and instrumentation have been designed with remarkable dynamic characteristics. SIRIUS presently ends in two experimental stations used for in situ X-ray characterization: a baby chamber and a chemical reactor, both mounted on a large seven-circle diffractometer. The rector is dedicated to atomic layer deposition and metal organic chemical vapor deposition of oxide materials. The third end-station, an in-vacuum diffractometer, will be operative by the end of 2016. SIRIUS offers several synchrotron radiation techniques which can be performed simultaneously or quasi-simultaneously on the same sample.

The OTFT characteristics, X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra, and grazing incident wide angle x-ray scattering (GIWAXS) spectra of two copper and three zinc phthalocyanines, with varying degrees of peripheral fluorination, were screened to determine sensitivity to THC vapor. Unsubstituted ZnPc was found to be the most sensitive material and, by tuning thin-film morphology, crystal polymorphs, and thickness through altered physical vapor deposition conditions, we increased the sensitivity to THC by 100x. Here we demonstrate that deposition conditions, and the resulting physical film characteristics, play a significant role in device sensitization.},

For the pure Mg2+ and Mn2+ aqueous solutions, the cations induce at the surface different 2D lattice superstructures of the organic monolayer. These superstructures correspond to an inorganic organized monolayer anchored to the hydrophilic group of the ordered behenic acid monolayer. Among the various diffraction peaks, we focused on those characteristics of the behenic acid oblique cell. As the Mg2+ mole fraction x increases in the Mg2+/Mn2+ mixed subphase, a continuous evolution of the oblique cell parameters is observed indicating the insertion of Mg2+ cations in the Mn2+ ordered monolayer. Then, a further increase leads to the appearance of a coexistence between two oblique surface phases. The cell parameters of both phases evolve continuously along the x range of the transition until a single Mg-rich ordered phase is detected. However, although the intensities of the peaks in the coexistence region are in agreement with a first-order phase transition, the cell parameters evolve simultaneously. Considering a thermodynamics analysis, this evidences that, apart from the concentration, another unidentified intensive parameter is varying. We suggest that it is the ionic strength, which appears to be strongly related to the concentrations.},

By changing the side chain end-group of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) from methyl to carboxylic acid potassium salt, we showed that the film structure is drastically changed from a highly ordered bilayer to a short-range organized monolayer. Using a comprehensive experimental approach from macroscopic length scale to molecular organization as well as simulations of diffraction patterns, the detailed structure of the crystalline P3HT bilayer was determined. Some similarities with the structure measured on thicker films deposited on solid substrates were evidenced such as the {$\pi$}-stacking distance, the interlayer spacing, and the edge-on conformation. Some differences were also pointed out, in particular the in-plane packing along the polymer backbones and the shift of the upper monolayer with respect to the bottom one in this direction. Such observations highlighted the influence of both the forced two-dimensional confinement and the nature of the substrate (water) on the P3HT film structure. The presence of a carboxylic acid potassium salt at the end of the side chain induced completely different behavior. Indeed, high pressures were necessary to observe a {$\pi$}-stacking of the thiophene units, but only short-range, and although the polymer keeps a monolayer organization independently of the pressure, a deep change in the polymer conformation was evidenced with the pressure.},

It represents a unique opportunity to access miniaturized organic electronic devices. The bottom-up construction of such integrated nanowires can be in principle generated by addressing the supramolecular polymerization process with a spatial precision that cannot be accessed by top-down approaches. However, most analytical techniques fail to access the fine structural and orientational features of such nanowires within electronic circuits at that scale. Even grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) poses major hurdles for the practical investigation due to beam path obstruction for most in-plane orientation of the samples. To overcome these limitations, we have implemented here a sensing modality based on GIWAXS collection for unique sample orientation and spot shape analysis in the reciprocal space allowing the entire film morphology to be accessed. In this case study involving triarylamine-based nanowires, we determine in a single experiment the packing structure of the supramolecular polymers interconnecting microelectrodes, together with their 3D and 2D orientational order parameters (S3D {$\approx$} 0.986 and S2D {$\approx$} 0.91). Our investigation demonstrates that the nanowires lie flat along the substrate and align along the normal to the electrodes. This alignment occurs with a coherence length of more than 100 nm, representing more than 200 molecules along the nanowire axis. Overall, this work highlights the great potential of GIWAXS to become a reference method for the full characterization of nanowiring processes with supramolecular polymers and self-assemblies integrated in complex device geometries.},

However, polymer semiconductor assembly has primarily been driven by solvent interactions. Here, we report poly(3-hexythiophene) homopolymer assembly driven and stabilized by oxidative doping with iron (III) p-toluenesulfonate in benzonitrile. By this improved method, dopant mol \% and addition temperature determine the size and morphology of oxidized polymer nanostructures. The dopant counterion provides colloidal stability in a process of dopant-stabilized assembly (DSA). Each variable governing polymer assembly is systematically varied, revealing general principles of oxidized nanostructure assembly and allowing the polymer planarity, optical absorption, and doping level to be modulated. Oxidized nanostructure heights, lengths, and widths are shown to depend on these properties, which we hypothesize is due to competing nanostructure formation and oxidation mechanisms that are governed by the polymer conformation upon doping. Finally, we demonstrate that the nanoparticle oxidative doping level can be tuned post-formation through sequential dopant addition. By revealing the fundamental processes underlying DSA, this work provides a powerful toolkit to control the assembly and optoelectronic properties of oxidatively doped nanostructures in solution.},

In particular, they ultimately control the electric double layer structure, hence the interaction between particles in aqueous solutions. Despite numerous achievements, progress in their understanding is still limited by the lack of experimental determination of the surface composition with appropriate resolution. Tackling this challenge, we have developed a method based on X-ray standing waves coupled to nano-confinement which allows the determination of ion concentrations at a solid--solution interface with a sub-nm resolution. We have investigated mixtures of KCl/CsCl and KCl/KI in 0.1 mM to 10 mM concentrations on silica surfaces and obtained quantitative information on the partition of ions between bulk and Stern layer as well as their distribution in the Stern layer. Regarding partition of potassium ions, our results are in agreement with a recent AFM study. We show that in a mixture of KCl and KI, chloride ions exhibit a higher surface propensity than iodide ions, having a higher concentration within the Stern layer and being on average closer to the surface by {$\approx$}1--2 {\AA}, in contrast to the solution water interface. Confronting such data with molecular simulations will lead to a precise understanding of ionic distributions at aqueous interfaces.},

Despite their significance, these processes are not well understood due to the lack of methods that can provide insight at the nanolevel into the very first stages of phase transitions. Taking advantage of synchrotron grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) and environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM), two pathways of the frosting process from supersaturated vapors were studied in real time for substrates with different wettabilities ranging from highly hydrophilic to superhydrophobic. Within GIWAXS, a fully quantitative structural and orientational characterization of the undergoing phase transition reveals the information on degree of crystallinity of the new phase and determines the ordering at the surfaces and inside the films at the initial stages of water/ice nucleation from vapor onto the substrates. The diversity of frosting scenarios, including direct desublimation from the vapor and two-stage condensation-freezing processes, was observed by both GIWAXS and ESEM for different combinations of substrate wettability and vapor supersaturations. The classical nucleation theory straightforwardly predicts the pathway of the phase transition for hydrophobic and superhydrophobic substrates. The case of hydrophilic substrates is more intricate because the barriers in Gibbs free energy for nucleating both liquid and solid embryos are close to each other and comparable to thermal energy kBT. At that end, classical nucleation theory allows concluding a relation between contact angles for ice and water embryos on the basis of the observed frosting pathway.},

  abstract = {Silicon phthalocyanines (SiPcs) have shown great potential as ntype or ambipolar organic semiconductors in organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs) and organic photovoltaics. Although properly designed SiPcs rival current state-of-the-art n-type organic semiconducting materials, relatively few structure-property relationships have been established to determine the impact of axial substituents on OTFT performance, hindering the intelligent design of the next generation of SiPcs. To address this omission, we have developed structure-property relationships for vapor-deposited SiPcs with phenoxy axial substituents. In addition to thorough electrical characterization of bottom-gate top-contact OTFTs, we extensively investigated SiPc thin films using X-ray diffraction, atomic force microscopy (AFM), grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS), and density functional theory (DFT) modeling. OTFT performance, including relative electron mobility ({$\mu$}e) of materials, was in general agreement with values obtained through DFT modeling including reorganization energy. Another significant trend observed from device performance was that increasing the electron-withdrawing character of the axial pendant groups led to a reduction in threshold voltage (VT) from 47.9 to 21.1 V. This was corroborated by DFT modeling, which predicted that VT decreases with the square of the dipole induced at the interface between the SiPc pendant and substrate. Discrepancies between modeling predictions and experimental results can be explained through analysis of thin-film morphology and orientation by AFM and GIWAXS. Our results demonstrate that a combination of DFT modeling to select prospective candidate materials, combined with appropriate processing conditions to deposit molecules with a favorable thin-film morphology in an ``edgeon'' orientation relative to the substrate, yields high-performance n-type SiPc-based OTFTs.},

  abstract = {Understanding the effect of surface chemistry on the dielectric-semiconductor interface, thin-film morphology, and molecular alignment enables the optimization of organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs). We explored the properties of thin films of bis(pentafluorophenoxy) silicon phthalocyanine (F10-SiPc) evaporated onto silicon dioxide (SiO2) surfaces modified by self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of varying surface energies and by weak epitaxy growth (WEG). The total surface energy ({$\gamma$}tot), dispersive component of the total surface energy ({$\gamma$}d), and polar component of the total surface energy ({$\gamma$}p) were calculated using the Owens-Wendt method and related to electron field-effect mobility of devices ({$\mu$}e), and it was determined that minimizing {$\gamma$}p and matching {$\gamma$}tot yielded films with the largest relative domain sizes and highest resulting {$\mu$}e. Subsequent analyses were completed using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) to relate surface chemistry to thin-film morphology and molecular order at the surface and semiconductor-dielectric interface, respectively. Films evaporated on n-octyltrichlorosilane (OTS) yielded devices with the highest average {$\mu$}e of 7.2 {\texttimes} 10-2 cm2{$\cdot$}V-1{$\cdot$}s-1 that we attributed to it having both the largest domain length, which were extracted from power spectral density function (PSDF) analysis, and a subset of molecules with a pseudo edge-on orientation relative to the substrate. Films of F10-SiPc with the mean molecular orientation of the {$\pi$}-stacking direction being more edge-on relative to the substrate also generally resulted in OTFTs with a lower average VT. Unlike conventional MPcs, F10-SiPc films fabricated by WEG experienced no macrocycle in an edge-on configuration. These results demonstrate the critical role of the F10-SiPc axial groups on WEG, molecular orientation, and film morphology as a function of surface chemistry and the choice of SAMs.},

However, OSCs still present stability issues under operational conditions that need to be surpassed for their industrialization. In this work, we investigated binary and ternary blends to examine their efficiency and their stability as active layers of OSCs. We used a fluorinated polymer (PF2) as an electron donor and two different electron acceptors, a fullerene derivative (PC71BM) and a NFA (EH-IDTBR). We demonstrated that using EH-IDTBR instead of PC71BM leads to a decrease in efficiency attributed to the low out-of-plane electron mobility measured in the blend. However, using EH-IDTBR as single electron-acceptor significantly enhanced the OSCs stability under continuous illumination. Ternary blends were tested to reach simultaneously a high efficiency and a long-term stability. The best efficiency/stability compromise appeared to be when using EH-IDTBR only as electron-acceptor. We identified changes in the main charge-carrier recombination mechanism in photo-degraded devices from bimolecular in low EH-IDTBR content blends to trap-assisted in high EH-IDTBR ones. Finally, the blend morphology at a nanometer scale appeared as stable in high EH-IDTBR content blends while photo-degradation impacted significantly the morphology of the low EH-IDTBR content blend.},

  abstract = {Organic electronics is the technology enabling truly flexible electronic devices. However, despite continuous improvements in the charge-carrier mobility, devices used for digital circuits based on organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) have still not achieved a commercial breakthrough. A substantial hurdle to the realization of effective digital circuitry is the proper control of the threshold voltage Vth. Previous approaches include doping or self-assembled monolayers to provide the threshold voltage control. However, while self-assembled monolayers-modified OFETs often do not show the level of reproducibility which is required in digital circuit engineering, direct doping of the channel material results in a poor on/off ratio leading to unfavorable power dissipation. Furthermore, direct doping of the channel material in organic semiconductors could cause the formation of trap states impeding the charge-carrier transport. Employing the concept of modulation-doped field-effect transistors (MODFETs), which is well established in inorganic electronics, the semiconductor--dopant interaction is significantly reduced, thereby solving the above-described problems. Here, we present the concept of an organic semiconductor MODFET which is composed of an organic--organic heterostructure between a highly doped wide-energy-gap material and an undoped narrow-energy-gap material. The effectiveness of charge transfer across the interface is controlled by the doping concentration and thickness of an undoped buffer layer. A complete picture of the energy landscape of this heterostructure is drawn using impedance spectroscopy and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy. Furthermore, we analyze the effect of the dopant density on the charge-carrier transport properties. The incorporation of these heterostructures into OFETs enables a precise adjustment of the threshold voltage by using the modulation doping concept.},

Different self-assembly behaviors are observed in pristine copolymer films, annealed copolymer films, and copolymer gels. We found that through cycle-doping, a process by which the sample is gelled and repetitively doped by solution, conjugated statistical copolymer gels have greater conductivities compared to thin films of the same polymers and maintain high conductivities after seven cycles of doping. Statistical copolymer gels at medium and high degrees of polymerization show the greatest conductivity, which is likely due to their unique morphology from that of the low degree of polymerization. Grazing incident wide-angle X-ray scattering suggests an inter charge transfer doping mechanism takes place between the polymer and dopant.},

Within the reverse electrodialysis applied in blue energy conversion, novel membranes with nanoscale confinement that function as selective ion transport mediums are currently in high demand for realizing higher power density. The primary challenge lies in constructing well-defined nanochannels that allow for low-energy barrier transport. This work proposes a concept for nanofluidic channels with a simultaneous dual electrostatic effect that can enhance both ion selectivity and flux. To actualize this, this work has synthesized propidium iodide-based two-dimensional polymer (PI-2DP) membranes possessing both skeleton charge and intrinsic space charge, which are spatially aligned along the ion transport pathway. The dual charge design of PI-2DP significantly enhances the electrostatic interaction between the translocating anions and the cationic polymer framework, and a high anion selectivity coefficient ({$\approx$}0.8) is reached. When mixing standard artificial seawater and river water, this work achieves a considerable power density of 48.4~W m               -2               , outperforming most state-of-the-art nanofluidic membranes. Moreover, when applied between the Mediterranean Sea and the Elbe River, an output power density of 42.2~W m               -2               is achieved by the PI-2DP. This nanofluidic membrane design with dual-layer charges will inspire more innovative development of ion-selective channels for blue energy conversion that will contribute to global energy consumption.},

We find the concentration of potassium cations in the Stern layer to be slightly higher than that of cesium cations.

  abstract = {In order to form a nanostructured metallic layer below a Langmuir monolayer, radiolysis synthesis was carried out in an adapted geometry that we call surface X-ray radiolysis. In this procedure, an X-ray beam produced by a synchrotron beamline intercepts the surface of an aqueous metal-ion solution covered by a Langmuir monolayer at an angle of incidence below the critical angle for total internal reflection. Underneath the organic layer, the X-ray beam induces the radiolytic synthesis of a nanostructured metal--organic layer whose ultrathin thickness is defined by the vertical X-ray penetration depth. We have shown that increasing the X-ray flux on the surface, which considerably enhances the kinetics of the silver layer formation, results in a second growth regime of silver nanocrystals. Here the formation of the oriented thin layer is followed by the appearance of a 3D powder of silver clusters.},

  abstract = {Interfaces in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) play a pivotal role in determining device performance by influencing charge transport and recombination. Understanding the physical processes at these interfaces is essential for achieving high-power conversion efficiency in PSCs. Particularly, the interfaces involving oxide-based transport layers are susceptible to defects like dangling bonds, excess oxygen, or oxygen deficiency. To address this issue, the surface of NiOx is passivated using octadecylphosphonic acid (ODPA), resulting in improved charge transport across the perovskite hole transport layer (HTL) interface. This surface treatment has led to the development of hysteresis-free devices with an impressive {$\approx$}13\% increase in power conversion efficiency. Computational studies have explored the halide perovskite architecture of ODPA-treated HTL/Perovskite, aiming to unlock superior photovoltaic performance. The ODPA surface functionalization has demonstrated enhanced device performance, characterized by superior charge exchange capacity. Moreover, higher band-to-band recombination in photoluminescence and electroluminescence indicates presence of lower mid-gap energy states, thereby increasing the effective photogenerated carrier density. These findings are expected to promote the utilization of various phosphonic acid-based self-assembly monolayers for surface passivation of oxide-based transport layers in perovskite solar cells. Ultimately, this research contributes to the realization of efficient halide PSCs by harnessing the favorable architecture of NiOx interfaces.},

  abstract = {Thin film photovoltaics based on Methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) have shown remarkable power con\- version efficiency. However, the presence of material and electronic defects poses challenges for perovskitebased electronic devices. To address these challenges, defect passivation using suitable metal salts is investi\- gated. In this work, the transition metal salt cuprous iodide (CuI) is used for defect passivation, modifying the optoelectronic characteristics, and enhancing photovoltaic performance. The incorporation of CuI alters the band structure of perovskite solar cells, resulting in enhanced charge extraction and changes in defect characteristics. Effective charge carrier density rises due to the alignment of band edges between the transport layer and the absorber layer, enhancing open circuit voltage and power conversion efficiencies. Capacitance-based measure\- ments are conducted to assess these improvements, providing insights into defect properties, charge trapping and de-trapping at defect sites, charge transport mechanisms, and charge accumulation. This work highlights the potential of CuI as a defect passivation strategy in perovskite solar cells. The performance and stability of these solar cells can be further optimised by adjusting the electronic characteristics of perovskite.},

  abstract = {refnx is a model-based neutron and X-ray reflectometry data analysis package written in Python. It is cross platform and has been tested on Linux, macOS and Windows. Its graphical user interface is browser based, through a Jupyter notebook. Model construction is modular, being composed from a series of components that each describe a subset of the interface, parameterized in terms of physically relevant parameters (volume fraction of a polymer, lipid area per molecule etc.). The model and data are used to create an objective, which is used to calculate the residuals, log-likelihood and log-prior probabilities of the system. Objectives are combined to perform co-refinement of multiple data sets and mixed-area models. Prior knowledge of parameter values is encoded as probability distribution functions or bounds on all parameters in the system. Additional prior probability terms can be defined for sets of components, over and above those available from the parameters alone. Algebraic parameter constraints are available. The software offers a choice of fitting approaches, including least-squares (global and gradient-based optimizers) and a Bayesian approach using a Markov-chain Monte Carlo algorithm to investigate the posterior distribution of the model parameters. The Bayesian approach is useful for examining parameter covariances, model selection and variability in the resulting scattering length density profiles. The package is designed to facilitate reproducible research; its use in Jupyter notebooks, and subsequent distribution of those notebooks as supporting information, permits straightforward reproduction of analyses.},

  abstract = {Aqueous dispersions of organic semiconducting nanoparticles (NPs) are particularly attractive as inks for the environmentally friendly preparation of organic solar cells. The internal morphology of the NPs, which depends on their elaboration process, is a key parameter, which has a significant influence on the final morphology of the active layer and therefore its effectiveness. In the present study, core-shell (PF2:PC71BM) NPs were prepared by miniemulsion. Their internal morphology including the composition of the two phases was characterized by scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) showing a core composed of 77\% PC71BM and a shell composed of 75\% PF2. It was found that thermal annealing promotes PC71BM diffusion from the core to the shell, increasing its proportion in the shell from 25\% to 42\%. This annealing, when applied after NPs deposition by spincoating, allows partial coalescence of the NPs, reducing the roughness of the active layer, and increases electron mobility, thus demonstrating the formation of PC71BM percolation paths for electron transport. A PCE of 1.6\% could thus be obtained after 10 min of thermal annealing at 100{\textopenbullet}C. At higher temperature, GrazingIncidence Wide-Angle X-Ray Scattering (GIWAXS) analyses demonstrate the modification of the PF2 structura\- tion from randomly oriented lamella after deposition to edge-on orientation after annealing, leading to an un\- favorable decrease of the hole mobility in the direction perpendicular to the substrate, while increasing the hole mobility in the substrate plane. This study demonstrates the need to systematically characterize the internal morphology of NPs in order to rationalize the morphology of the active layer and optimize its properties.},

  abstract = {Aggregates -- that is short-ranged ordered moieties in the solid-state of {$\pi$}-conjugated polymers -- play an important role in the photophysics and performance of various optoelectronic devices. We have previously shown that many polymers change from a disordered to a more ordered conformation when cooling a solution below a characteristic critical temperature . Using in situ time-resolved absorption spectroscopy on the prototypical semiconducting polymers P3HT, PFO, PCPDTBT, and PCE11 (PffBT4T-2OD), we show that spin-coating at a temperature below can enhance the formation of aggregates with strong intra-chain coupling. An analysis of their time-resolved spectra indicates that the formation of nuclei in the initial stages of film formation for substrates held below seems responsible for this. We observe that the growth rate of the aggregates is thermally activated with an energy of 310 meV, which is much more than that of the solvent viscosity (100 meV). From this we conclude that the rate controlling step is the planarization of a chain that is associated with its attachment to a nucleation center. The success of our approach for the rather dynamic deposition method of spin-coating holds promise for other solution-based deposition methods. {\copyright} 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym.

Considering its rising popularity, the aim here is to accelerate the required learning curve for new experimentalists by clearly detailing the underlying analytical concepts which can be leveraged to maximize GIWAXS studies of polycrystalline thin films and devices. Motivated by the vast range of measurement conditions offered, together with the wide variety of compositions and structural motifs available (i.e., from single-crystal and polycrystalline systems, to quantum dots and layered superlatices), a comprehensive framework for conducting effective GIWAXS experiments is outlined for different purposes. It is anticipated that providing a clear perspective for this topic will help elevate the quality of future GIWAXS studies---which have become routine---and provide the impetus required to develop novel GIWAXS approaches to resolve unsettled scientific questions.},

This paper describes a freeware program named REFLEX, which is a standalone program dedicated to the simulation and analysis of X-ray and neutron reflectivity from multilayers. This program was first written two decades ago and has been constantly improved since, but never published until now. The latest version of REFLEX covers generalized types of calculation of reflectivity curves including both neutron and X-ray reflectivity. In the case of X-rays, the program can deal with both s and p polarization, which is quite important in the soft X-ray region where the two polarizations can yield different results. Neutron reflectivity is calculated within the framework of non-spin-polarized neutrons. REFLEX has also been designed to include any type of fluid (such as supercritical CO2) on top of the analysed film and includes corrections of the footprint effect for analysis on an absolute scale.},

  abstract = {Rubrene single crystal domains with hundreds of micrometers size fully covering different substrates are achieved by thermal annealing of evaporated amorphous thin films with the help of a thin glassy underlayer. The sufficiently large energy level offset of the underlayer material and rubrene enables high performance staggered bottom gate rubrene crystalline transistors with maximum field-effect linear mobility over 5 cm2V-1s-1 ({$\mu$}Avg~=~4.35~{\textpm}~0.76 cm2V-1s-1) for short channel devices of 20 {$\mu$}m, comparable to high quality rubrene bulk single crystals. Moreover, since molecular dopants up to several mole percent can be incorporated into the single crystals with a minimal disturbance of the lattice, the contact resistance of the transistors is significantly reduced to around 1 kOhm.cm by contact doping via adlayer epitaxy of p-type doped rubrene. Our results pave the way for novel high-performance organic electronics using crystalline active materials with mass-production compatible deposition techniques.},

  abstract = {Material properties frequently relate to structures at or near surfaces, particularly in thin films. As a result, it is~essential to understand these structures at the molecular and atomistic levels. The most accurate and widely used techniques for characterizing crystallographic order are based on X-ray diffraction. When dealing with thin films or interfaces, standard approaches, such as single crystal or powder diffraction, are not suitable. However, X-ray diffraction under grazing incidence conditions can provide the required information. In this Primer, grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) is comprehensively introduced, starting from basic considerations on X-ray diffraction at crystals with reduced dimensionality and the optical properties of X-rays, followed by a more in-depth description of an experimental performance, including X-ray sources, goniometers and detectors. Experimental errors, limitations and reproducibility are discussed. Various applications, from highly ordered inorganic single crystal surfaces to weakly ordered polymer thin films, are presented to illustrate the potential of GIXD. Data visualizations, representations and evaluation strategies are summarized, based on the example of anthracene thin films. The Primer compiles information relevant to perform high-quality GIXD experiments, evaluate data and interpret results, to extend knowledge about X-ray diffraction from surfaces, interfaces and thin films.},

  abstract = {The ternary blend approach accomplished improved spectral coverage and enhanced the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the role of the third component in improving the photovoltaic parameters needs critical analysis. Here, we introduced a wide band gap n-type twisted perylene diimide (TPDI) into the PM6:Y6 blend as a third component that improves spectral coverage and morphology, resulting in an overall increase in the efficiency of the OSCs. TPDI acts as an antenna for efficient energy- and charge-transfer processes. A systematic study compared charge- and energy-transfer dynamics and the orientational dependence nanomorphology of ternary blends with those of their binary counterparts. Femtosecond transient absorption measurements reveal enhanced hole-transfer efficiency in finely tuned ternary mixtures. This study provides a rational approach to identifying a third component to improve light management and morphology. These parameters enhance the energy and charge-transfer processes, improving the PCE of OSCs.},
