  abstract = {We present a new beamline of Synchrotron SOLEIL dedicated to the study of thin films, nanostructures, and advanced materials via X-ray diffraction and spectroscopy in the energy range 1.4--12 keV. This range covers most of the absorption edges of interest in the fields of semiconductors and functional oxides. In order to meet the increasing demand of advanced real-time characterization of nanoscale materials, the beamline optics and instrumentation have been designed with remarkable dynamic characteristics. SIRIUS presently ends in two experimental stations used for in situ X-ray characterization: a baby chamber and a chemical reactor, both mounted on a large seven-circle diffractometer. The rector is dedicated to atomic layer deposition and metal organic chemical vapor deposition of oxide materials. The third end-station, an in-vacuum diffractometer, will be operative by the end of 2016. SIRIUS offers several synchrotron radiation techniques which can be performed simultaneously or quasi-simultaneously on the same sample. We show here some examples of the first in situ results obtained at the beamline.},

Several sample environments are available and adapted to X-ray measurements. Thanks to high-resolution Soller slits, the in-plane scattering wave vector resolution is better than 0.02 nm--1. For GISAXS measurement scattering wave vector lower than 0.05 nm--1 have been already reached and this will be improved in the future. Special attention has been paid to enable simultaneous or at least consecutive use of all these techniques on the same sample.},

This includes a simplified model builder for beginners, simple samples, additional sample models, statistical error analysis and the use of just-in-time compilation modules for the reflectometry kernel to achieve higher performance. In addition, the influence of experimental errors on the reflectivity curve is discussed, and new features are described that allow the user to include these in the error statistics to improve the fitting and uncertainty estimation.},

  abstract = {The SIRIUS beamline of Synchrotron SOLEIL is dedicated to X-ray scattering and spectroscopy of surfaces and interfaces, covering the tender to mid-hard X-ray range (1.1--13 keV). The beamline has hosted a wide range of experiments in the field of soft interfaces and beyond, providing various grazing-incidence techniques such as diffraction and wide-angle scattering (GIXD/GIWAXS), small-angle scattering (GISAXS) and X-ray fluorescence in total reflection (TXRF). SIRIUS also offers specific sample environments tailored for in situ complementary experiments on solid and liquid surfaces. Recently, the beamline has added compound refractive lenses associated with a transfocator, allowing for the X-ray beam to be focused down to 10 {\textmu}m {\texttimes} 10 {\textmu}m while maintaining a reasonable flux on the sample. This new feature opens up new possibilities for faster GIXD measurements at the liquid--air interface and for measurements on samples with narrow geometries.},

  abstract = {The use of X-ray and neutron reflectivity has been generalized worldwide for scientists who want to determine specific physical properties (such as electron-density profile, scattering-length density, roughness and thickness) of films less than 200 nm thick deposited on a substrate. This paper describes a freeware program named REFLEX, which is a standalone program dedicated to the simulation and analysis of X-ray and neutron reflectivity from multilayers. This program was first written two decades ago and has been constantly improved since, but never published until now. The latest version of REFLEX covers generalized types of calculation of reflectivity curves including both neutron and X-ray reflectivity. In the case of X-rays, the program can deal with both s and p polarization, which is quite important in the soft X-ray region where the two polarizations can yield different results. Neutron reflectivity is calculated within the framework of non-spin-polarized neutrons. REFLEX has also been designed to include any type of fluid (such as supercritical CO2) on top of the analysed film and includes corrections of the footprint effect for analysis on an absolute scale.},
