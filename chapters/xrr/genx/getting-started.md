# Getting started

We still start this tutorial with a pre-defined, almost empty, file. You can download [the GenX file here](./chapters/xrr/genx/examples/water_init.hgx) and the XRR data here.

We will assume that you have a fresh start on GenX, without any prior file. We will go step by step through all the parameters that need to be filled in, with explanation on how to find them. If you want to start with a predefined file, you can find some in the section [Examples](genx-examples).
