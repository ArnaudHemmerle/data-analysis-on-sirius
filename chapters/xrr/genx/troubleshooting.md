# Troubleshooting

This tutorial was written using GenX version 3.7.4 on macOS. There may be differences in behavior with other versions or operating systems.

## Freeze at startup

A known issue is that GenX may freeze during startup. To resolve this, try disabling your internet connection when launching GenX and re-enabling it afterward. Additionally, the software may crash occasionally, so it is highly recommended to save your work frequently.

## Don't forget the units of q

It is common to forget to convert the q data from the SIRIUS beamline, in ${\rm nm}^{-1}$, to the units used by GenX, in ${\rm A}^{-1}$. Refer to this [section](genx-correct-q) to learn how to make the conversion.
