## Trilayer on a solid substrate

Here is an example to show that complex systems can be fitted as well. It is a trilayer of the phospholipid DSPC deposited on a Si substrate using the Langmuir-Blodgett method. After some work, particularly in finding an initial guess—which requires experience and a review of the literature—it is possible to achieve a good fit.

The model consists of 14 layers and 34 fit parameters in total.

The file can be found [here](../../../_static/xrr/genx/trilayer_fit_done.hgx) and used as a starting point for similar systems.
