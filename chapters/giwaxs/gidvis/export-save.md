# Save & export

You can save your project by clicking on `File>Save Project`. In the window `Save Project`, click on the beamtime to include in your save (here only `Tutorial.mat`). You can add extra files to the archive that will be created, if needed.

If you've missed any steps, you can download the file corresponding to the current tutorial [here](../../../_static/giwaxs/gidvis/tutorial.GIDzip).

Export: to be done.
