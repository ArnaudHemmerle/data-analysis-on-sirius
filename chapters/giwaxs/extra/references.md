Sometimes, looking at what others have done and how they have done it can be a good starting point for analyzing our own data. Here is a collection of potentially useful references.

## Description of the GIWAXS setup on SIRIUS

The GIWAXS setup of SIRIUS has been described in this paper {cite:p}`hemmerle2024`. Please refer to this paper in the experimental section of your publications. To know more about the beamline, you can check these references {cite:p}`ciatto2016, fontaine2014`. For insights into the use of GIWAXS on SIRIUS (and STXM on the beamline HERMES) for organic electronics, see this reference {cite:p}`swaraj2023`.
