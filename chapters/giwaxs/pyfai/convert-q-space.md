# Load images & convert to q-space

## Load images

Run the next cell as is. You may want to adjust the image contrast by modifying the `vmin` value.

```python
# Run this cell as is

# Load images
img_A = fabio.open(path_A).data
img_B = fabio.open(path_B).data

# You may want to adjust the contrast of the image with vmin and vmax
vmin = np.nanpercentile(img_A,10)
vmax = np.nanmax(img_A)

...

```

This will create a folder to store all further results, with its name based on the first imageâ€™s filename.

The two displayed images, in pixels, correspond to measurements taken at each detector angle. Each image is actually the sum of all images acquired during the scan.

## Conversion to q-space
The next step is to convert from pixel space to q-space.

Modify the maximum in-plane and out-of-plane q you want to reach in the image, and run the cell.

```python
# Modify only the maximum q you want to reach in the images, and run the cell
max_qip = 20 #in-plane, in 1/nm
max_qoop = 20 #out-of-plane, in 1/nm

...
```
