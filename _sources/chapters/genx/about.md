# About GenX

## What is GenX?

GenX is a program developed by Artur Glavic that provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for fitting reflectivity data. It can be downloaded from [this link](https://aglavic.github.io/genx/index.html), with versions available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. The official documentation is accessible [here](https://aglavic.github.io/genx/doc/index.html).

## Why Use GenX?

Many software tools are available for fitting X-ray or neutron reflectivity data. GenX stands out by offering a user-friendly GUI, which is particularly convenient for non-experts in the field. However, it may not be as efficient as code-based programs for batch fitting large datasets.

Like any fitting software, GenX requires several parameters to be configured and some initial setup time before it is ready to process data. This manual is designed to guide SIRIUS users in using GenX effectively, especially for systems commonly studied on the soft matter branch of the beamline (e.g., organic molecules at an air-water interface, self-assembled monolayers on solid substrates, etc.).

## Please Cite GenX!

The SIRIUS beamline is not involved in the development of GenX; we are simply users, just like you. However, it is evident that a significant amount of time and effort went into creating such a powerful tool. If you use GenX to analyze your data, please cite the following paper: {cite:p}`glavic2022`.

## Troubleshooting

This tutorial was written using GenX version 3.7.4 on macOS. There may be differences in behavior with other versions or operating systems.

A known issue is that GenX may freeze during startup. To resolve this, try disabling your internet connection when launching GenX and re-enabling it afterward. Additionally, the software may crash occasionally, so it is highly recommended to save your work frequently.
