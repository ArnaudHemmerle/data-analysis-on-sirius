# Analyzing GIWAXS with GIDVis

## What is GIDVis?

GIDVis is a MATLAB program designed to analyze grazing incidence diffraction images. It can be downloaded from [this link](https://www.if.tugraz.at/amd/GIDVis/index.html). Executable versions are available for Windows and Linux (no MATLAB required), or as source code in MATLAB. The official documentation is accessible on the GIDVis [website](https://www.if.tugraz.at/amd/GIDVis/index.html).

## Why use GIDVis?

There are not many software tools available for processing GIWAXS (Grazing Incidence Wide-Angle X-ray Scattering) data. GIDVis stands out by offering a user-friendly GUI, which is particularly convenient for non-experts in the field. This tutorial is designed to guide SIRIUS users in effectively using GIDVis to convert detector images into reciprocal space and analyze the positions of diffraction peaks. Note that out-of-plane integration of the GIWAXS data is not easy with GIDVis, and requires some extra data treatment, for example using Python.

## Please cite GIDVis!

The SIRIUS beamline is not involved in the development of GIDVis; we are simply users, just like you. However, it is clear that a significant amount of time and effort has gone into creating this powerful tool. If you use GIDVis to analyze your data, please cite the following paper {cite:p}`schrode2019`. Additionally, refer to the [About](https://www.if.tugraz.at/amd/GIDVis/About.html) section on the GIDVis website to learn more about the development team and the GIDVis license of use.
