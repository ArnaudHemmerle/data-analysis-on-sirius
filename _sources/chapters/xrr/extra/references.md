X-ray reflectivity is a well-established technique, and you should easily find general literature on the topic, starting from the various references provided throughout this tutorial.

## Description of the XRR setup on SIRIUS

A paper describing our setup for XRR on the gas-liquid interface is yet to be published. Until then, you can cite this paper {cite:p}`hemmerle2024`, which provides a general description of the beamline, for your papers using XRR on SIRIUS. To learn more about the beamline, you can refer to these references: {cite:p}`ciatto2016, fontaine2014`.

## XRR data obtained on the beamline

Sometimes, looking at what others have done and how they have done it can be a good starting point for analyzing your own data. Here is a list of papers containing XRR data acquired on SIRIUS on soft matter systems (updated in November 2024): {cite:p}`jabrallah2016, malloggi2019, chapron2024, kharlamova2024`.
